00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.400
So, my parents were born in Colombia...

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.800
In a town called Santuario, in eastern Antioquia.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.600
My dad came from a very humble family...

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.700
They lived near a rural community called Cruces.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.700
My dad went to primary school in Cruces...

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.100
When his teacher realized how smart he was...

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.900
She asked the town's priest to help him continue studying... 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.500
Since in Cruces they only had a primary school. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.900
My dad? He was happy...

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.500
Studying was very important for him.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.000
He was the only one in his family that finished high-school...

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.300
With a lot of hardships, though...

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.500
He'd iron his classmates' clothes...

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.300
To be able to pay for his studies.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.100
My mom comes from a family from Santuario, as well...

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.000
A family that was prosperous at the time...

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.500
They had a tableware business.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.000
My mom grew up in a very big family...

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.300
They were sixteen children.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.700
My grandma was very strict...

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.800
And that influenced my mom's personality...

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.900
I think her mom was simply too rigid and strict.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.200
So when my mom fell in love with my dad...

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.000
Her mom and her brothers didn't accept him...

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.400
Because he had darker skin.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.400
My mom's family had light skin...

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.800
Blue eyes, green eyes...

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.400
And also because he came from a poor family.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.600
So, in the beginning he'd visit her...

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.700
But my grandma would sit in the window next to them...

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.100
While they talked, she'd sit next to them.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.200
Eventually, they prohibited my dad from visiting...

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.600
So he started sending her letters.
